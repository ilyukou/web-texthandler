    	It was a cold, dreary day and the country was white with snow, causing the sparsely settled village of Hickorytown to look even more desolate than usual. Old Deacon Joshua Marlowe and his wife were seated in the dingy kitchen of the old farmhouse, and it was plainly to be seen that they were both worried and angry.
    The farmers elbows were on his knees and his head between his hands, and as he sat in silent meditation he spitefully chewed a long wisp of straw. Martha Marlowe dried her eyes with her apron now and then, and finally a decided sniff evinced to her husband that she was cying. Instead of becoming more calm at this sign of his wife’s grief, Deacon Marlowe raised his head and scowled at her angrily.
