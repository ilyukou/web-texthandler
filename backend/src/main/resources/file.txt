	When Tom Wilders, a lean, lanky, close farmer from his own town, asked to marry Samantha; he gave her to him without a word, and his eldest daughter, who inherited her mother’s meekness, accepted him for a husband, knowing that she loathed the fellow.
	Only a little while after the marriage, Tom Wilders called on the deacon. His interview with his was strictly private, but in some way it cost the deacon exactly five hundred dollars. The first picture was that of a tall young man, with dark, trusting eyes and a tender smile that was almost irresistible.
